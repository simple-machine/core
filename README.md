# core
The library/cli app to interface with the microcontroller using the protocol

## Purpose
This is what should run on the computer. To allow easy integration with a wide range of applications, a statically linked library is available, usable as a C library.

For testing and demonstration purpose, a Command-Line application is made available. The library should be used for real applications, though.

The header file created when compiling the library is documented, so you should read it.
